Band Name Generator 

A simple beginner-friendly Python project that generates a band name based on user input.
This project is part of my Python learning journey and version-controlled using Git and GitHub, with a focus on building DevOps fundamentals early.

Project Overview

The Band Name Generator asks the user:

The city they grew up in

Their pet’s name

It then combines these inputs to suggest a potential band name.

This project demonstrates:

Basic Python syntax

User input handling

String concatenation

Running Python scripts from the command line

Git-based version control

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Git

GitHub

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites

Python 3 installed
Check with:

python --version

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git


Navigate into the project directory:

cd <repository-name>


Run the script:

python band_name_generator.py

Example Output
Welcome to the Band Name Generator
What's the name of the city you grew up in? :London
What's your pet's name? :Rocky
Your band name could be London Rocky

Learning Goals

Build confidence with Python basics

Practice Git and GitHub workflow (init, commit, push)

Lay groundwork for DevOps practices such as automation, scripting, and CI/CD later on

Future Improvements (Optional)

If you want this project to actually matter:

Add input validation

Convert it into a function

Add unit tests

Wrap it in a Docker container

Run it via a CI pipeline

If you don’t improve it, it stays a toy. Your move.
