Band Name Generator 

A simple beginner-friendly Python project that generates a band name based on user input.
This project is part of my Python learning journey and version-controlled using Git and GitHub, with a focus on building DevOps fundamentals early.

Project Overview

The Band Name Generator asks the user:

The city they grew up in

Their pet’s name

It then combines these inputs to suggest a potential band name.

This project demonstrates:

Basic Python syntax

User input handling

String concatenation

Running Python scripts from the command line

Git-based version control

Technologies Used

Python 3

Git

GitHub
